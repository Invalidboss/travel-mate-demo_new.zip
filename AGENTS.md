# AGENTS.md — Travel Mate

## Goal
Evolve this prototype into a production-grade travel expense app. Always write tests for new code and keep rules as data.

## Tech Guardrails
- React + TS (strict), Vite build
- Tailwind for styling
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library (to be added)

## Domain Rules (simplified)
- DE per-diem: 14€ (>=8h), 28€ (24h). Arrival/Departure day 14€.
- Meal reductions: breakfast -20%, lunch -40%, dinner -40% of the base.
- Mileage (private car): 0.30 €/km.

## Task Pattern
For each feature: data model + UI + tests + docs.
